## fizzbuzz.cpp
We created a producer and consumer function to put data into the buffer and to output some data back for our multiple threads. The producer will use a counter variable to keep track of the amount of items going into the buffer and will tell us whether it's full or not. Once the producer thread sleeps, the consumer thread will output an integer, fizz, buzz, and fizzbuzz based on the integer.
